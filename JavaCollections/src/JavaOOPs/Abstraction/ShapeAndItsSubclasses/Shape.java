/*
* In the above examples of Shape and Monster,
* we encountered a problem when we create instances of Shape and Monster and run the getArea() or attack().
* This can be resolved via abstract method and abstract class.

An abstract method is a method with only signature (i.e., the method name, the list of arguments and the return type)
*  without implementation (i.e., the methodâ€™s body).
*  You use the keyword abstract to declare an abstract method.
* */

/**
 * A class containing one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract class
 * must be declared with a class-modifier abstract. An abstract class CANNOT be instantiated, as its
 * definition is not complete.
 */
/**
 * This abstract superclass Shape contains an abstract method getArea(), to be implemented by its
 * subclasses.
 */

/**
 * This property of the abstract class solves our earlier problem. In other words, you can create
 * instances of the subclasses such as Triangle and Rectangle, and upcast them to Shape (so as to
 * program and operate at the interface level), but you cannot create instance of Shape, which avoid
 * the pitfall that we have faced.
