 * Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.

/*
 * Abstraction, in the context of OOP,
 *  refers to the ability to hide complex implementation details
 * and show only the necessary features of an object.
 * This simplifies the interaction with objects,
 *  making programming more intuitive and efficient.
 * It provides a clear separation between what an object does and how it achieves its functionality,
 * fostering a higher level of understanding and collaboration among developers.
 * */

/**
 * There are primarily two types of abstraction implemented in OOPs. One is data abstraction which
 * pertains to abstracting data entities. The second one is process abstraction which hides the
 * underlying implementation of a process.

/**
 * One class only need to know what the other class does (by interface ), but not how it does it.
 */

/**
 * In object-oriented programming, abstraction refers to the practice of exposing strictly necessary
 * functionality to external objects while hiding implementation details. This enables callers of
 * the code to make use of complex programming logic inside an object without the need to understand
 * it.
 */

/**
 * In summary, data abstraction in OOP involves presenting a simplified view of complex data
 * structures and operations. Achieved through Encapsulation
 */

/**
 * Process abstraction in software development refers to hiding the underlying operational details
 * of a process while exposing only the essential methods or actions that can be performed while
 * communication between the objects. process abstraction enhances readability and reduces
 * complexity, making software more comprehensible and manageable for both developers and users.

/*
 Abstraction-Achieved through interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.
             Providing a simplified view of complex systems.

 Encapsulation- Achieved through access modifiers (public, private, protected) and classes.
                Protecting data and providing a clear interface for interaction.

/**
 * In summary, an abstract class provides a template for further development. The purpose of an
 * abstract class is to provide a common interface (or protocol, or contract, or understanding, or
 * naming convention) to all its subclasses. For example, in the abstract class Shape, you can
 * define abstract methods such as getArea() and draw(). No implementation is possible because the
 * actual shape is not known. However, by specifying the signature of the abstract methods, all the
 * subclasses are forced to use these methods' signature. The subclasses could provide the proper
 * implementations.
