/* Substitutability:
 * A subclass possesses all the attributes and operations of its superclass (because a subclass inherited all attributes and operations from its superclass).
 * This means that a subclass object can do whatever its superclass can do.
 * As a result, we can substitute a subclass instance when a superclass instance is expected, and everything shall work fine.
 * This is called substitutability.

/*
 * Cylinder is a subclass of Circle.
 *  We can say that Cylinder "is-a" Circle (actually, it "is-more-than-a" Circle).
 * Subclass-superclass exhibits a so called "is-a" relationship.
