  /*
      * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a powerful paradigm used in Java and other languages. Let's explore the benefits of OOP in Java:

  1. **Modularity and Reusability**: OOP allows you to break down your program into smaller, reusable modules (objects). These objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). By reusing existing classes, you save development time and improve code maintainability.

  2. **Clear Structure**: OOP provides a clear structure for your programs. You work with classes and objects, making it easier to organize and manage your code.

  3. **Abstraction**: Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

  4. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal details (data and methods) are hidden from other parts of the program. This promotes security and prevents unintended interference.

  5. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. It helps eliminate redundant code and promotes code reuse. For example, you can create a subclass (child class) that inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass (parent class).

  6. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables you to use a single interface (method or operation) to represent different types of objects. It allows flexibility and extensibility in your code.

  In summary, OOP enhances code quality, promotes reusability, and makes programs easier to understand and maintain. However, it's essential to apply OOP judiciously based on the project's requirements and your design skills¬π‚Å¥. üöÄ

  /*
      * Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages are designed to overcome these problems.
  The basic unit of OOP is a class,
  *  which encapsulates both the static properties and dynamic operations within a "box",
  * and specifies the public interface for using these boxes.
  * Since classes are well-encapsulated, it is easier to reuse these classes.
  *  In other words, OOP combines the data structures and algorithms of a software entity inside the same box.
  OOP languages permit higher level of abstraction for solving real-life problems.
  * The traditional procedural language (such as C and Pascal) forces you to think in terms of the structure of the computer (e.g. memory bits and bytes, array, decision, loop) rather than thinking in terms of the problem you are trying to solve.
  * The OOP languages (such as Java, C++ and C#) let you think in the problem space, and use software objects to represent and abstract entities of the problem space to solve the problem.

  /*
      * Object-Oriented technology has many benefits:

  Ease in software design as you could think in the problem space rather than the machine's bits and bytes. You are dealing with high-level concepts and abstractions. Ease in design leads to more productive software development.
  Ease in software maintenance: object-oriented software are easier to understand, therefore easier to test, debug, and maintain.
  Reusable software: you don't need to keep re-inventing the wheels and re-write the same functions for different situations. The fastest and safest way of developing a new application is to reuse existing codes - fully tested and proven codes.
