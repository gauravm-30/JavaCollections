 *Certainly! **Encapsulation** in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.
 * It allows you to bundle data (instance variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class).
 *  By controlling access to this class's methods and data, encapsulation provides several benefits:

1. **Private Instance Variables**: Always mark your class variables as **private** to prevent unauthorized access.
* This ensures that the internal state of an object remains consistent and secure.

2. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Provide **public getter and setter methods** to control access to private data.
* These methods allow you to read and modify the encapsulated variables.
*  You can also enforce data validation or additional logic within these methodsÂ¹.

For practical examples, here are some exercises related to encapsulation in Java:

1. **Person Class**:
   - Create a class called `Person` with private instance variables for `name`, `age`, and `country`.
   * Implement public getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying these variables.

2. **BankAccount Class**:
   - Create a class called `BankAccount` with private instance variables for `accountNumber` and `balance`.
   * Provide public getter and setter methods for these variables.

3. **Rectangle Class**:
   - Create a class called `Rectangle` with private instance variables for `length` and `width`.
   *  Implement public getter and setter methods for these variables.

4. **Employee Class**:
   - Create a class called `Employee` with private instance variables for `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `employee_salary`.
   * Provide public getter and setter methods for `id` and `name`, and a getter method for the formatted salary.

5. **Circle Class**:
   - Create a class called `Circle` with a private instance variable for `radius`.
   * Implement public getter and setter methods for the radius.
   * Additionally, provide methods to calculate the area and perimeter based on the current radius value.

6. **Car Class**:
   - Create a class called `Car` with private instance variables for `company_name`, `model_name`, `year`, and `mileage`.
   *  Allow access to company name, model name, and year through public getter and setter methods.
   *  However, only provide a getter method for mileage.

7. **Student Class**:
   - Create a class called `Student` with private instance variables for `student_id`, `student_name`, and `grades`.
   * Implement public getter and setter methods for `id` and `name`.
   * Additionally, create a method called `addGrade()` to add grades to the `grades` variable while performing validationÂ¹.

// Advantages of Encapsulation
/*Certainly! Encapsulation in Java offers several advantages:

1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation restricts access to data members by hiding them.
When you declare instance variables as `private`, they can only be accessed within the class.
Public methods (getters and setters) provide controlled access to these variables, ensuring data integrity and consistencyÂ¹.

2. **Control Over Data**: By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make a class instance variable as  read-only or write-only.
This flexibility allows you to skip unnecessary getter or setter methods,
giving you better control over your dataÂ³.

3. **Improved Code Readability**: Encapsulation hides the internal complexity of a class.
Other classes interacting with it only need to know the public interface (methods),
making the code easier to read, understand, and maintainÂ².

Remember that encapsulation is like a protective shield, preventing unauthorized access to data and promoting better software design! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
