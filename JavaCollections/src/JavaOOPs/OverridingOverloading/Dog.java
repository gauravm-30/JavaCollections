    * Yes, when you create an instance of `Dog` using the statement `Animal a1 = new Dog();`, both the constructors of `Dog` and `Animal` classes will be called. Let me explain why:

  1. **Inheritance and Constructors**:
     - When a subclass (like `Dog`) extends a superclass (like `Animal`), it inherits all the members (fields and methods) of the superclass.
     - Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created. They are called automatically when an object is instantiated.
     - In Java, if a subclass constructor does not explicitly call a superclass constructor using `super(...)`,
     *  the compiler automatically inserts a call to the superclass's default (parameterless) constructor as the first statement in the subclass constructor.

  2. **Constructor Chaining**:
     - In your case, the `Dog` class implicitly calls the parameterless constructor of the `Animal` class (since you haven't explicitly called any superclass constructor).
     - The constructor chaining works as follows:
       1. `Dog` constructor is invoked.
       2. Before executing any code in the `Dog` constructor, the compiler inserts a call to the `Animal` constructor (parameterless) using `super()`.
       3. The `Animal` constructor initializes any fields specific to the `Animal` class.
       4. Then, the `Dog` constructor continues with its own initialization logic.

  3. **Order of Execution**:
     - The superclass constructor (`Animal` constructor) is called before the subclass constructor (`Dog` constructor).
     - So, the sequence of constructor calls is: `Animal` constructor â†’ `Dog` constructor.

  4. **Explicit Superclass Constructor Call**:
     - If you want to explicitly call a specific constructor of the superclass (e.g., a parameterized constructor of `Animal`), you can do so using `super(...)` in the `Dog` constructor.
     - For example:
       ```java
       public Dog() {
           super("Some animal name"); // Explicitly call Animal's parameterized constructor
           // Other initialization logic for Dog
       }
       ```
     Remember that constructor chaining ensures that the superclass's state is properly initialized before the subclass's constructor executes.
  * If you don't explicitly call `super(...)`, the default constructor of the superclass is invoked automatically.
    * */
